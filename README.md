# heatplot
Stata module to create heat plots and hexagon plots

`heatplot` creates heat plots from variables or matrices. One
example of a heat plot is a two-dimensional histogram in which the
frequencies of combinations of binned Y and X are displayed as
rectangular (or hexagonal) fields using a color gradient. Another example
is a plot of a trivariate distribution where the color gradient is used to
visualize the (average) value of Z within bins of Y and
X. Yet another example is a plot that displays the contents of a matrix,
say, a correlation matrix or a spacial weights matrix, using a color
gradient.
